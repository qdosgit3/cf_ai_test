The frontend for a modern implementation of the historic ELIZA AI psycologist.

Made up of the following features:
- Typescript compilation checking
- Rollup.js bundling
- State maintained within client via React's setState
- Response CSS via CSS grid


Quickstart:
```
npm install
npm run start
```

Front-end accessible here: https://cf-ai-eliza2.qdosgit3.workers.dev

Based on React, Rollup, Typescript.

Built in 1 day for a Cloudflare application.

Heavily influenced by a small Rollup-React app I built in 2023, whilst learning Javascript.
